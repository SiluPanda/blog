title: Hosting a blog on github pages
---
Github gives a free option to host webpages of your own with an extension of github.io. Developers can have a portfolio website or a demo of a project, or even a blog page. This post is regarding how I hosted this blog on github pages. Follow the steps to get your blog page right away:

1. Check out Jekyll <https://jekyllrb.com/> which is a static web page generator tool which converts plain text to webpages, blogs etc.
2. Choose a blog theme which suits your needs.
3. Either download the compressed source file or fork the github repo to your own.
5. Name your directory with your own name. Change the base URL in _connfig.yml file.
6. Change the branch to gh-pages and keep it as the default branch.
7. If you already have a github page, you can check your blog directory as username.github.io/baseurl , here baseurl is the url set by you in the above step.
8. If you don't have a page, create one. Oh! ofcourse.
9. Boom! You have your blog live on internet.

The theme used by me is, emerald. To get this theme, you can directly search for emerald on github. It's pretty cool, isn.t it?
